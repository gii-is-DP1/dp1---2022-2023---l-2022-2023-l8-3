# What is Petris
Petris is a game about bacterial control for two players and minutes of playing time.
Each player embodies a scientist who should control the propagation of the bacteria under their supervision. Those bacteria are hungry and they are always looking for food in the adjacent Petri dishes. Watch out! The bacteria that remain alone in a Petri dish will eat a lot and they will reproduce... making it more complicated to control them! 

During the game you must manage the propagation of your bacteria, for them to reproduce less, thus not to risk the culture in the Petri dishes. At each phase of
contamination, you will get contamination points for each Petri dish where you have more bacteria than your opponent. At the end of the game, the player with fewer contamination points will be the winner!
